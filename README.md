Dimensions are copied from https://github.com/misode/mcmeta/tree/1.21.1-data/data/minecraft/dimension and their biome tags replaced.


Side effects:

- No more villages in the overworld (maybe pre-generate if you are starting a new world)
- Nether portals can be created in the end

TODO:

- on load call gamerules function
- is_hill
- mod for disabling elytra in cobblemon dimension?
- bikes

cobblemon:is_end returns normal end TODO: need to find a biome generator for the end?
